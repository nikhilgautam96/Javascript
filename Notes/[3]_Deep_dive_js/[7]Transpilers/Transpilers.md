# Transpilers :-

-   It is used to convert code written in newer version of JS into code that can run in older environments.
-   Example :-
    1. Babel
    2. TypeScript
    3. Coffescript
    4. Dart.

# USe Case Scenario :-

-   Sometimes in apps like Instagram we see that, adds open up in the application window itself and not in seperate browser tab. This is called `in-app browser`.
-   Such browsers don't have big budgets so they need these transpilers to support code written in newer JS versions.
